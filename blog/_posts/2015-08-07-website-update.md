My old website and blog theme has been feeling kind of outdated for a while. When I bumped into the nice, mobile-friendly [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/), it was clear that I needed to change my site. After a busy summer with my family I finally found the time to make the update. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Some things I would like to add in the future
