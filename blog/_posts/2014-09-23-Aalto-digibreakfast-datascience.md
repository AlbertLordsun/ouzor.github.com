Last week I participated the [Aalto Digi Breakfast on Data Science](http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/platforms/digi/data_science/). The Digi Breakfast meetings cover timely topics in digitalization in Aalto University, such  as [Industrial Internet](http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/platforms/digi/industrial_internet/) and now data science. The idea is to better connect the world-class data science research and companies in the Helsinki area.

The program was quite tight, with a lot of short and even shorter talks from both Aalto and companies. There were lots of familiar faces from my time in the Aalto university and [HIIT](http://www.hiit.fi/), and it was interesting to now listen to the talks from the company side.

Maybe the most interesting talk was given by Hekki Mannila [], a famous computer scientist and current president of the Academy of Finland [], and former Aalto vice rector and HIIT director. He gave ten suggestions for data scientists, which I liked a lot:

List the ten, include a photo? Comment

Sami Kaski [], my former Phd supervisor, summarised the research conducted in the Center of Excellence in Computational Inference COIN []. The focus of COIN is to create both faster inference methods for statistical models and models that scale to really large data sets. Other presenters from Aalto included X, Y, Z.

There were also concrete efforts to facilitate collaboration between companies and the university. Nurminen [] introduced the idea of a data science education with a project and hackathon and asked for collaboration in the form of data sets that would interest students. Here I suggested also using open data that could be used to tackle some of the biggest societal problems. Another effort was the Aalto Data Hub, a linkedin group [] for sharing data sets and big data experiences.

There were also several companies presenting, such as Comptel [] and Elisa []. Comptel is one of the leading data science companies in Finland, as it bought Xtract a few years ago. Now they were preparing their own tool of big data analysis. Elisa, a telecom company, has huge amounts of data but does not yet have the data science expertise to utilize it, and hence they were looking for research opportunities.

All in all, a very good session in just one and a half hours. Will look forward to the future sessions and maybe even presenting something related to open data or my data, who knows.
