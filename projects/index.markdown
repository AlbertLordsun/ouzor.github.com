Open knowledge projects
=======================

Here I have listed some projects related to open knowledge that I am or have been involved in.

Open source tools for open data
-------------------------------

In my spare time I have been developing open source tools for processing, analyzing and visualizing open data with a few Finnish [friends](http://louhos.github.io/contact.html). It all started with the [Louhos](http://louhos.github.io/) project, with our [sorvi-package](http://louhos.github.io/sorvi/index.html) winning the Apps4Finland 2011 data opening category. Since then, our [blog](http://louhos.github.io/news/2014/06/07/uusiblogi/) ([migrated](http://louhos.github.io/news/2014/06/07/uusiblogi/) from [Wordpress](http://louhos.wordpress.com/) in June 2014) has received more than 30000 views. 

Currently we are actively developing [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io/) - R Ecosystem for Open Government Data and Computational Social Science. The sorvi package has been [split](http://louhos.github.io/news/2014/06/07/uusiblogi/) to more focused [packages](http://ropengov.github.io/projects/). Personally I am developing the [helsinki](https://github.com/rOpenGov/helsinki) and [gisfin](https://github.com/rOpenGov/gisfin) packages, supported by the Finnish [Datademo funding](http://datademo.fi/english/).

**Selected achievements**

* [Datademo](http://datademo.fi/) funding for the [helsinki](https://github.com/rOpenGov/helsinki) and [gisfin](https://github.com/rOpenGov/gisfin) packages. Details (in Finnish) [here](http://datademo.fi/ensimmaisen-kierroksen-tulokset/) and [here](http://datademo.fi/kevatkierroksen-tulokset/). I was also interviewed in [Citiscope](http://www.citiscope.org/story/2014/how-helsinki-mashed-open-data-regionalism) and filmed for a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p733z0bUlnw).
* Apps4Finland 2013: Third place in the visualization category with the [Alueellinen hyvinvointi-visualization](http://spark.rstudio.com/ouzor/Sotkanet/) that was [developed together](http://www.demoshelsinki.fi/kasi-ylos-jos-yhteiskunta-ja-data-kiinnostavat/) with Juha Lepp√§nen and Satu Korhonen from Demos Helsinki. [Details (in Finnish)](http://www.apps4finland.fi/kilpailutyo/alueellinen-hyvinvointi/).
* Apps4Finland 2011: Victory in the data opening category (both official and audience votes): sorvi - R toolbox for open data. [Details (in Finnish)](http://apps4finland.fi/2011/10/24/datan-avaus-sorvi-avoimen-datan-tyokalupakki-r-kielelle/).

* Apps4Finland 2012: Victory in the data opening category (official and audience votes): Data elections. [Details (in Finnish)](http://apps4finland.fi/2012/10/28/datan-avaus-datavaalit/).
* Apps4Finland 2012: Victory in the data guide category (audience votes): Finnish data wiki. [Details (in Finnish)](http://apps4finland.fi/2012/09/22/dataopas-suomalainen-datawiki/).


My data
-------

My data has emerged as an important topic beside open data. I have been actively involved in the [OKFI My Data working group](http://fi.okfn.org/wg/my-data/) and also developing some [code](https://github.com/ouzor/mydata) for analyzing my data from various sources.


Open science
------------

I have been somewhat actively involved in the [OKFI Open Science work group](http://fi.okfn.org/wg/openscience/).
