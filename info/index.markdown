## Background

I studied bioinformation technology in Helsinki University of Technology, with major in bioinformatics and minor in business strategy. I joined the research gorup of Prof. Samuel Kaski first as a research student and continued by doing my master's thesis about biological and social network analysis.

I also stayed in the group for a PhD, switching the research topic more towards molecular medicine. You can read more about my research in the [Projects](/projects/#research) page. Machine learning, bioinformatics and information visualization. Close collaboration with biological and medical experts. 

I have also been actively taking part in the Finnish open knowledge seen, creating open source tools for analyzing open data first in Finland with the sorvi package and now internationally, building the rOpenGov community. I am also interested in the open science movement, not least by my own experiences in conducting not-so-open science during my PhD. A recent interest is My Data, where I among other things took part in commenting a report that tried to define some concepts and write down what My Data is all about. More about that later, too.

I have recently started as a senior data analyst at Avaus Consulting, and hence learning a lot of the business-related things that are essential in what we call data science (more about the definition of data science in a future post). Although much of what we do is confidential, I think there will also be plenty of experiences to share (see Avaus open stuff). Also big data will be a topic.
