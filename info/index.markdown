Research topics
---------------

I develop computational techniques to solve data-rich applications in
human microbial ecology, functional genomics, and parliamentary monitoring. 
There is a great demand for targeted computational tools to extract
information from poorly characterized data collections in order 
to understand the data and to predict future outcomes
with minimal human intervention. By combining information across
multiple, complementary measurement sources it is possible to overcome
some of the limitations and statistical uncertainties associated with
individual data sets. Open source implementations turn the new models 
into accessible tools that can guide further modeling and experimentation.

Human microbiomics
==================

Human gut microbiota constitutes one of the most densely populated
ecosystem on our planet. It carries 150-fold more unique genes than
our own genome, it is highly dynamic in space and time, and a key
contributor to immune system, digestion of food, and various health
complications.  Characterizing the overall structure, variability, and
health associations of this poorly understood virtual metabolic organ
forms a major challenge for contemporary human biology.  In
[Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen
University](http://www.mib.wur.nl/UK/), we work to understand
large-scale properties of the human gut ecosystem by carrying out
comprehensive meta-analyses of high-throughput microbial profiling
data obtained with the Human Intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip)
microarray, which has been used to probe the relative abundancies of
one thousand gut-specific bacterial phylotypes in a hundred studies
and thousands of individuals.  {[Poster at

Functional genomics
========

Mapping of the three billion base-pair human genome sequence in 2001
was the first step towards uncovering the dynamic and contextual
functional properties of the genome. Understanding functional
organization of genetic information and its regulation through
transcriptional, epigenetic, and other mechanisms remains a key
challenge for human biology. In the thesis work, I developed open source
machine learning algorithms for data integration in functional genomics.

publications](/work/pubs/) and the [PhD
thesis](http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2010/isbn9789526033686).

Government data
========

In spare time I co-develop algorithmic tools for parliamentary
monitoring in Finland. Our dedicated R library for open
government data in Finland received [Double award in the Apps4Finland
2011 Data Opening Category](http://apps4finland.fi/fi/en): both the
official competition and the public votes. Check the
[Louhos](http://louhos.github.com/en) repository for more information.
