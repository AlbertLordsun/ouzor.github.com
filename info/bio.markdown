Graduate studies and beyond
===========================

2003 M.Sc.(Tech.), [Engineering Physics and Mathematics](http://www.hut.fi/Yksikot/TeknillinenFysiikka) at [Helsinki University of Technology](http://www.hut.fi); [Machine Learning and Bioinformatics group](http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/mi) of the Neural Networks Research CoE.

2002 (summer) Meteorological institute. Zagreb, Croatia. Started by measuring weather parameters at a weather station on Bilogora hills, close to the Hungarian border, drinking wine and shooting clouds to prevent hail. Later I moved to Zagreb to manipulate compex-valued matrices for weather forecasting purposes.

Switzerland. Simulating potential decay channel of [Higg's
boson](http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/cern/ideas/higgs.html) into
two tau leptons and possible implications of symmetry violation in
weak interaction to particle detection with the Large Hadron Collider.

2001 Founding Amnesty International student group in Helsinki
University of Technology (chair 2001-2004)

2000 Volunteer at the Indian NGO
